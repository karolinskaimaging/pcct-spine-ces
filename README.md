## PCCT Protocol Details

- The optimized PCCT protocol parameters enable high-resolution imaging with minimized artifacts, particularly for identifying spinal canal stenosis and nerve compression.  

- Protocol includes settings for pitch, kVp, keV, monoenergetic reconstruction, and optimal radiation dose (CTDIvol).  

- Scan time: ~6 seconds for the lumbar spine (Th11-S2).

- Full details are available in the original research paper.
